# Telerik window play

I am in the early stages of rewriting an old desktop application in Blazor. The app has one main window, and pops up child windows showing (say) lists of customers, charities, etc.

Clicking an individual customer or charity would open another child window wih the details.

I am experimenting with different ways to do the same in Blazor.
